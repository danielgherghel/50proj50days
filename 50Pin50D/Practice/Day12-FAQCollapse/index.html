                What is the meaning of life?
            </h3>

            <p class="ask-text">
                Answer: The meaning of life is a philosophical question that has puzzled humans for centuries. There is
                no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the meaning of life is subjective and varies from
                person to person. Some people believe that the purpose of life is to seek happiness, while others
                believe that it is to fulfill a certain destiny or goal.
